# ðŸ“Š Netflix Movie Duration Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project explores trends in movie duration over release years using Netflix data. By leveraging **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**, I created a **scatter plot** to visualise the relationship between release year and movie duration.

## ðŸ“‚ Files  
- `Netflix_Data_Scatter_Plot.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualisation.  
- `netflix_data.xlsx` â€“ Dataset with Netflix movie information.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Features  
âœ” **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Filtered movie data from an Excel dataset, handled missing values, and ensured consistency.  
âœ” **Genre-Based Colour Coding**: Assigned different colours to movie genres for enhanced visual analysis.  
âœ” **Scatter Plot Analysis**: Examined whether movie durations have decreased over time.  

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements  
- Expand the analysis by incorporating additional features such as **genre, ratings, and country trends**.  
- Perform a **comparative study** with movie trends on other streaming platforms.  
- Integrate **machine learning models** for predictive analysis.  

## ðŸ“œ License  
This project is open-source and available under the **MIT License**.
